Bugs:

certain globals lead you to a simple definition with no docs on submodules, methods etc.

e.g.: finding process.setuid
    'process?' takes you to a node w/ no child methods, etc. because those are under 'Process', which is in miscs['Global Objects'][5] ;   

solution to issue 1: 
    - In addition to recursing from doctree, also recurse from docTree.miscs[4] and docTree.miscs[5] (Errors and Process). 
    - develop a system to conditionally capitalize certain tokens (when there is just one token, in the case of a global name where the docs have it capitalized, but in node, it's lower case).
    'process' should be looked up in docs as 'Process'.examine docs further and 
-   


parse procedure:

possible tokens:

single segment:
    a (user binding)
    dns (built-in)

multiple segments:
    a.b (user binding)
    dns.setServers (built-in)

token has dot?
