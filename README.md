# node-help

### The *always-available* but not *always up-to-date* documentation module for your Node REPL 

`node-help` is a standalone command-line REPL that lets you append a question mark to any valid JavaScript token to get information it. It is inspired by iPython

Currently, only Node.js documentation is available. This means no `Array.prototype?`, etc., but JavaScript docs are coming soon.

With `node-help`, you can do this:

````javascript
node-help > process.env?

````
