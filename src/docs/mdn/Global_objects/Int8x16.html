<p class="warning">SIMD.js has been <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_simd" class="external" rel="noopener">taken out of active development in TC39</a> and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a>, with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.</p>

<p>The <strong><code>SIMD.Int8x16</code></strong> data type is a 128-bit vector divided into 16 lanes storing 8-bit signed integer values.</p>

<p>In addition to the simple creator functions, the SIMD API provides the following constructor functions:</p>

 <dt><a href="SIMD/splat.html" title="SIMD.js has been taken out of active development in TC39 and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore.

 <dd>Creates an Int8x16 with all lanes set to a given value.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that you can also <a href="#Data_conversions">convert from another SIMD data type to Int8x16</a>.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> SIMD types don't work with <code>new</code>, as SIMD values are no "boxed" objects (comparable to <code>String(s)</code> vs. <code>new String(s)</code>, which creates a String object).</p>

<pre class="brush: js example-bad">var v = new SIMD.Int8x16(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16); 
// TypeError: SIMD.Int8x16 is not a constructor
var w = new SIMD.Int8x16.splat(3); 
// TypeError: SIMD.Int8x16.splat is not a constructor
</pre>

<p>Instead, you just write:</p>

<pre class="brush: js example-good">var v = SIMD.Int8x16(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16);
